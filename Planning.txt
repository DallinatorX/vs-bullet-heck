I am going to do a Bullet Hell game.
The twist on this over others is that
it is going to be two player. One 
player will controll the main ship,
the other will be the "bad guy".
Each will get powerups to use.

Must Have:
The game must have both players 
be able to controll and to shoot
at each other. Player one will have 
a set number of lives while player 2
will have an amount of HP.

Nice to have:
A few things that would be nice to 
have is power ups, a pause menu,
controler support, a consle, and
an options menu


Classes:
	Actor
		player one ship
		player two ship
		bullet
		pause menu
	Action
		Fire bullet
		detect collision
		controll actors
		draw actors
		move actors
		handle off screen (used for some
			power up if bullets reflect)
		power ups
			star fire
			fast fire
			cross pattern fire
			clone ship
	Other
		audio service
		physics service
		input service
		output service
		options menu
